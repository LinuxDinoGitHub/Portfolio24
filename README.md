# LinuxDino's 2024 Digital Portfolio (Never finished)

This was my first-ever portfolio using raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (No frameworks, just pure 2000s-style front-end developing). The concept around this portfolio is my character of the dinosaur, mainly themed around the Jurrasic time environment. I managed to complete the pre-home page which is a dino game, and the home page as well. 

I am taking a break from this for a while since I don't really have the motivation to finish this right now, it's been over a week since I edited this as I am on vacation as well. 

I have fallen victim to the hands of laziness and relaxation.

Anyways...

# How to run my crappy website on your computer


1. Clone this repository to your local machine in a desired location by running the command `git clone https://github.com/LinuxDinoGitHub/Portfolio24.git`.
2. Run the project however you want, but I will show you how to use VS code and the Live Server extension to run the portfolio.
3. Locate the cloned repository in a command prompt window and change directories to where you cloned the repository, e.g.`cd C:/User/Downloads/Portfolio24_WHEREEVER_YOU_CLONED_IT`.
4. Run `code .` to go to VS code.

5. Select 'Yes, trust the authors.' when/if prompted.

7. Once it has finished installing, a button should appear on the bottom right displaying the text 'Go Live', if not, use [this tutorial]([url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kEOkw_LvGU)) to troubleshoot.
